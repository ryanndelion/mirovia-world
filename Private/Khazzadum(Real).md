The homeland of the dwarves in Mirovia. Boasts the tallest mountains in the continent, and many massive dwarven cities under the surface, the dwarves' current leader being Kjungr of House Hjodlik. The border with Gorgoroth is often contested and is known as 'The Land of the Dead'. The central areas of Khazzadum were the original location of the Cataclysm on the Material plane, and that area is now known as Blightmoor, an endless expanse of dead, lifeless ash. Skulls of titans who clashed here remain half buried in the ash, and small communities have formed within these skulls, seeking shelter from the horrible aberrations that stalk the ashlands, ever hungry.
