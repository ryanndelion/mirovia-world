	- Military: Led by an elite group of leaders given the title Primus.

A special branch called Praetors are purely comprised of mortal soldiers and focus on intelligence and espionage-based operations.

They are also involved with the Oculo and Praetors to ensure that magical disturbances and magic-induced violence is quashed.
