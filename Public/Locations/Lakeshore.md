In the rural north-west of [[Neverfield]], south of the Shimmering Lake lies the tiny, rural town of Lakeshore. Bordering the foothills of the Orrin Hills, Lakeshore was founded in 445 P.C. when barley planted in the Moonbright Plains was found to be particularly good for brewing mead. Lakeshore now thrives on brewing and exporting mead to all of Neverfield, as well as to some other regions via the [[Northern Pass]].
