Carrealvis is a small town in [[Helonde]] nestled in the massive Karum Fjord, an inlet from the Sanguine Sea. Legend has it that Carrealvis was founded when legendary Belhaven pirate Samuel Seawhisk was shipwrecked by a freak whirlpool, only to be rescued by a shoal of sentient dolphins. As a symbol of his gratitude, he captured and sold the entire shoal to the highest bidder, instantly becoming rich enough to start a settlement. Carrealvis now thrives on trading exotic aquatic life, as well as exporting timber from the Pelsari Forest and exotic spices from the deserts of [[Ashana]].

**Races :** Mix of many kinds of races. Primarily human, elf, half elf, half orc, halfling, no dwarves.

**Total inhabitants :** 10k

**Protection :** high wooden fences around the city, with a city guard (called the Noldorin) around 100 strong. There is also a small team of enforcers called the Barracudas (15 members or so). They are independently contracted by the city administration to ensure that trade occurs safely.

**Government :** Led by Mayor Lura Bromwood, half-elf female. Has various aides and consuls to help run the administration and manage the economy.

**Legal system :** Noldorin are in charge of arrests, but any larger crimes are dealt with by the Barracudas. Leader of Noldorin is Captain Chance Pannan, a half-goliath, half-halfling man with a penchant for police violence.

**Religion :** Waukeen, Goddess of Trade, the Golden Lady. Umberlee, the queen of the sea, the wavemother. Silvanus, god of nature, Old Father Tree.

**Income :** Fish, timber, trading spices between Ashana and Belhaven.

**Food source :** Fish. Some farmers living outside city walls plant barley and vegetables. But mostly traded in from Lonas, which is a riverside town and so more productive for planting grains.

**Economy :** Extremely wealthy in general, but there is a lower class of citizens living in and around the central market. They are exploited by their sellers and buyers, being middlemen who take very little of the gold in any transaction. Most conflict within the city is between feuding families vying for business growth. Industrial espionage is rife and the ‘weaker’ companies are eradicated by Atrium Aei.
