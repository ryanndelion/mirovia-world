A gorgeous old town located within the [[Veyrines Valley]], Maguilla is home to three great beauties: 
1. The River Essonne, pristine and winding through the shadow of Sierra Ecrins. 
2. The Blanchet vineyard, lush and sickly sweet in the summer. 
3. Finally, the ancient olive grove in Nortebanco, planted where the first mountain folk from Mount Ecrins descended into the valley. To this day, the descendents of those mountain people still rear sheep and tend to the olive grove. 
The brick houses in older neighbourhoods are vibrantly colored in shades of green, orange and red, thanks to the shamanic beliefs of the [[Mountainfolk]]. Maguilla today is a rustic, warm, welcoming place with plenty of vegetation and animals.
