# As Above, So Below: A Mirovian Fable

A Black Sun rises over the floating city of [[Nionosea]], capital of the [[Ancosian Republic|Republic of Ancosia]]. Arcanists of the [[Biblioplex]] have fallen into a slumber most deep. Rumors whisper of a shadowy figures plotting to usurp the Laetum Assembly. Artifacts of deicide from ages long past awaken, ravenous and uncontained. Who will arise to right the wrongs of Mirovia's past?

- The [[Enlightened Ones]], shapers of mortalkind, are dead. Today, [[The Exalted|Exalted]] mortals walk in their place, drawing from the divine domains first channeled by the Enlightened.
- The [[Laetum Assembly]] knows all, and sees all. Transgressions against the Ancosian Code are punished by the judiciary and military branches of the [[Ancosian Republic]].
- A Black Sun now rises over Nionosea. Magic and technology that relies on direct sunlight is weakened.
- The study of arcane items and magics is paramount. Arcanists in the Biblioplex and [[Highcastle Academy]] seek and study artifacts that were lost in the Arcane and Enlightened Ages.
- The [[Tulkari Insurgency]] of 936 P.C. led to the radicalization of many disillusioned common-folk. Various new political organizations, such as [[New Ancosia]], [[Nionosea for Nionoseans]] and the [[Company of Eminspur]] have gained increasing support from the rabble in the past decade.

# Welcome to Mirovia

The year is 953 P.C. (Post Cataclysm). Since [[The Cataclysm]] brought about ruin and destruction to the once thriving lands of Mirovia, the continent has been divided by vastly diverse biomes and political powers. [[Ancosia]], a collection of city-states united under the strong leadership of the [[Laetum Assembly]], leads the study of ancient arcane technologies which were once lost. To its east, [[Helonde]], a nation of open trade and cultural freedom, and [[Ashana]], ruled mercilessly by a God-Emperex, lie in a tentative truce after the conclusion of the [[Tulkari Insurgency]]. In the cold, unforgiving north, [[Vinda]] is a region of little sustenance, though its largest city, [[Ellondia]] houses a budding magocracy.
The proud kingdom of [[Neverfield]] is ruled by a long line of great warrior kings, their military might belying their small population. North of the warring nation of [[Gorgoroth]] lies the massive region known as [[Khazzadum]]. Southern Khazzadum houses the expansive wastes and scarred badlands of [[Blightmoor]], overrun by all manner of strange terrors - remnants of the Cataclysm. Far to the east lies the mysterious region known as [[Rifenmist]], said to be cursed by the gods for its aristocracy’s past transgressions.
