The northenmost region in Mirovia, the city of Ellondia stands as a beacon amongst the poor and delapidated towns that dot the cold and windy region. Uncivilized and desolate, much of Vinda's northern coast in uninhabitable. Many a mage has made the long, cold trek to Ellondia, for it has been said that the very last surviving Weaveshifter lives in isolation within the city's walls. Though many have made the trip, few have revealed any details of what they saw.
