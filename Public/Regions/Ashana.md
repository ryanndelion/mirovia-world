Ashana is the shining jewel of Mirovia, a desert nation full of the wildest riches and hottest summers. In its capital Sanahar resides the ever revered God-Emperex Mansour-ki-Vor, and Ashana's open trading and cultural freedom belies the iron grip that the Emperex's Cardaces have over the common folk. They say that whence entering any of Ashana's vibrant, intoxicating megacities, one will either fall in love, become rich, or die in a ditch with a slit neck. Whichever it is, depends on your wits.
