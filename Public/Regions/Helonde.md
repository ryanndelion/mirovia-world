Helonde is home to a melting pot of cultures and races, having been the main landing point for travelers from Belhaven for hundreds of years. It is ruled by Melith-Ndarre, The Mothers of the Wind, who are the descendants of those who first landed in Helonde nearly a thousand years ago. The new settlers of the city now called [[Ortem-Velak]] were refugees from [[Belhaven]], and quickly saw value in creating strong trade routes in what would become a new Mirovia. House Tallashi, whose military might initially seized control of the vibrant forests and azure waters of the nation, remain primarily in control of administrative and military matters. Their current matron is Taenya Tallashi, whose 5-year governance has been characterized by increased trade and economic growth, despite the looming threat of invasion from Gorgoroth in the far West. 

In Helonde, gold is everything. As Ancosian philosopher/political commentator Gilbert Gagnon wrote: ‘To be Helondian is to work, to work is to be wealthy, and to be wealthy is to be happy’. As long as trade remains strong and the gold continues to flow into the treasury, the Melith tend to leave each city to their own devices. Religion varies wildly across the land, though most worship deities relevant to their trade.
