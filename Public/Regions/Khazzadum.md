The central areas of Khazzadum were the original location of the Cataclysm on the Material plane, and that area is now known as Blightmoor, an endless expanse of dead, lifeless ash. Skulls of monstrosities who clashed here remain half buried in the ash, and small communities have formed within these skulls, seeking shelter from the horrible aberrations that stalk the ashlands, ever hungry. To the east of Blightmoor lies Hero's Rock, a wild and chaotic shanty town that is home to the [[Ratcatcher's Court]], a mishmash of ne'er-do-wells who still hunt the remnants of the Cataclysm to this day.
