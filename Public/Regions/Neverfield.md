Neverfield is home to the [[Lyandorian Empire]], which emerged well over a thousand years ago. It is said that the kingdom was formed after [[Lord Derrick Lyandor]] singlehandedly slew a Beholder, as though blessed by the Gods themselves. Heroic deeds notwithstanding, the diplomatic tendencies of Lord Lyandor led to the rise of Neverfield as a crossroads for trade between its neighbouring regions, as well as a major exporter and distributor of various grains and alcohol. The current leader, [[Lord Roland II]], who is now in his 83rd year, has sought to improve on the region’s infrastructure and army after the events of the [[Tulkari Insurgency]]. Under his rule, most are left to their own devices. People live as they did before, but the Empire takes a tithe of what is produced in exchange for safety and security from strange creatures that stalk the plains and forests at night. Manically religious, Lord Roland II has also reinstated temples across the region, mandating weekly prayers and offerings to [[The Triad]]. Worship outside of these deities results in imprisonment, causing tensions to brew in the more rural areas of the region. The ever-increasing might of the Lyandorian Legion serves to keep these tensions in check.
