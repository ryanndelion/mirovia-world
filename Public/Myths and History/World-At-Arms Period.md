This era is the modern age, which began with only a small proportion of mortals remaining after [[The Cataclysm]]. Banding together and forming hunting parties, mortals began cleansing Mirovia of the monstrosities that remained. With a new pantheon in place, albeit one with limited control over mortals, order was restored to the world. Since the Gods were once mortals, their command of their domains turned out to be weaker than the Enlightened before them.

Over the years, more mortals undertook the ascension, leading to a diversification of each primary domain -- the power of a God was tied to a smaller sub-domain, and relied on having worshipers to maintain control.

With the destruction of the flying cities and technologically advanced nations of the [[Arcane Age]], magic and technology in Mirovia had to be reconstructed in often haphazard ways. New kingdoms were formed either by survivors of the Cataclysm who had access to powerful magic, or by great warriors or mages who had slain monstrosities that remained from the Cataclysm.

Modern Mirovia is fractured by the political powers that arose in that recovery period after the Cataclysm -- great warring kingdoms in [[Gorgoroth]], heroic kings and queens of [[Neverfield]], sophisticated republics in [[Helonde]], and the chaotic [[Ratcatcher's Court]] in [[Khazzadum]]. Several major conflicts have emerged since the beginning of the period, though perhaps the most influential were the [[War of A Thousand Tribes]] and the [[Tulkari Insurgency]]. Though racial divides have blurred and dangerous secrets leftover from the Cataclysm abound, Mirovia is--and always will be--a place of unending optimism and industriousness.
