The Arcane Age began with the end of the Enlightened Age, with mortaldom losing access to all divine gifts. In the absence of these gifts, mortals had to create new arcane magics. This was a time of great technological advancement, and mortalkind began to develop techniques that could emulate or even surpass divine magic. Great cities and houses were formed, and the utopic magocracy served to improve the quality of life for most living beings. Historians believe that the Arcane Age held the most knowledge and theoretical understanding of any time period, though most of it was lost in the Cataclysm.
